# 🔐 Door Automation System — KRS Project

A secure, smart biometric access system for the KIIT Robotics Society room — combining real-time face recognition and spoof detection. This project ensures only genuine users can unlock access using AI-driven verification.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To develop a **contactless, real-time, and spoof-proof** door access control system using facial recognition and liveness detection. This solution automates door entry for registered users, while protecting against spoofing attacks (e.g. printed photos or videos).

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Real-Time Face Recognition**  
  Utilizes `face_recognition` library for accurate, low-latency identification.

- 🧠 **Liveness Detection with Anti-Spoofing**  
  Integrated with [SilentFaceAntiSpoofing](https://github.com/minivision-ai/SilentFaceAntiSpoofing) and MiniFASNet models.

- 🔐 **Secure Login/Logout System**  
  Maintains access logs with timestamps for all entry and exit events.

- 👤 **User Authentication**  
  Only registered faces are allowed — unauthorized users are denied.

- 🧻 **Log Files & Tracking**  
  Tracks entries/exits with visual proof and timestamps.
